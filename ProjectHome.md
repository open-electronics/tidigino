TiDiGino is a GSM remote control based on a ATMEGA2560 chip.
This GSM library is derived from one developed by HWKitchen but has been adapted to our hardware. In particular, we use the second serial of the ATMEGA2560 to manage the GSM module SIM900.

The library is similar to the GSM SHIELD library host on http://code.google.com/p/gsm-shield-arduino/
